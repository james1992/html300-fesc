# Site Design Plan

### Colors, typography and layout


### Design Components

One of the main issues with the Florida Energy Systems Consortium Site (http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu/) is that it is a very busy website.  There are multiple navigation bars to review and their is neither a consistent layout or color palette.  To aid users in navigating the site there is a need to simplify the overall design.

The first step in simplifying the design is implementing a visually appealing and easy to navigate homepage.  While looking for inspiration from existing websites I stumbled across the home page of 10 Thousand Design (https://www.10thousanddesign.com/) and immediately saw how the design choices could be applied to the FESC website.

The webpage includes visually appealing background images that change based on the content category you highlight.  The webpage is very easy to navigate.  It has the main links that are visible in the main content area of the page, a hamburger menu in the top right and the company logo in the top left that returns to the homepage.

The images do a great job of helping the user identify the type of content they will find with each link.  If the content the user is looking for is not available in that list there is the hamburger menu.  The hambuger menu when clicked uses a smooth animation to transition to the menu which takes up the entire screen.  In total the main page contains sixteen total links while the FESC page has at least thirty.  The hamburger menu is also something I would like to implement on every page of the site so that the menu is constent across the site.

A minor element that would improve the FESC site is a call to action button in the top right to allow users to signup for the mailing list instead of placing a form input at the bottom of the page.  This way the call along with the hamburger menu would be consistent across the site.
