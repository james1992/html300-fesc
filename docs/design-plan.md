# Site Design Plan

### Colors, typography and layout

For the redesigned FESC website I would like to reduce the number of competing colors on the screen.  Right now there are so many different colors in just the navigation bars that users eyes are drawn all over the page and it is difficult to focus on the most important content on the page.  In the new site the number of background colors will be reduced to a single darker color (blue, grey, black, etc.).  The text on the other hand will be something that is in stark contrast to the background to make it pop off the page.  

The overall style of the text will not be famboyant but instead will feature Roboto (Body) and Open Sans (Headings) so as not to distract the user from the content of the webpage (https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Open+Sans:800|Roboto).  Given that this is a scientific website the font should be relatively conservative.

The layout of the site will be simplified significantly to reduce the number of pages a user needs to visit to locate information.  The landing page will contain minimal information about the consortium to give the user a basic understanding of the group.  The focus of the page will be on the larger screen width size images in the background that guide the user through a list of navigation options to explorer the group in greater detail.  Sub-content will be grouped by their target audience (student, resident, scientist, etc.) instead of by area of study.  Each subpage will feature vertical scrolling to different pieces of information within the group.  There will only be one navigation bar at the top of the page, no secondary vertical navigation bars.

The navigation bar will consist of hamburger menu that on click will open a menu that fills the entire page but is simplified and contains no more than 10 links.  The goal is to funnel the user to what they are searching for as quickly as possible.

### Design Components

As previously mentioned that homepage will include full page images and a limitted selection of navigation options to view subcontent.  The homepage will be unique from the rest of the site pages in that it will be limtted to the size of the display (there should be no scrolling regardless of device).  The rest of the pages will utilize vertical scrolling from one piece of information to the next.  In this way the number of webpages will be greatly reduced making the website easier to manage moving forward.

The header and footer will be the same on every page.  The header will include three items.  In the upper left will be a company logo that serves a dual purpose it reminds the user what site they are on and on click it will return them to the homepage.  Then in the upper right there will first be a call to action button that will open a form to allow the user to sign up for the mailing list and second will be a hamburger menu which on click will expose the website menu.  The footer will include contact information for the consortium and links to share the site on social media (Facebook and Twitter).

In terms of modules the site will need several different modules that can be applied at various locations throughout the site.  Most of these elements will be rectangular in nature to accomodate the vertical scrolling design.  The first is banner image that spans the entire display width, the second and third are text mixed with images (either an image on the right or left of the screen) and the final rectangular module is all text.  These module will all have the same height to prompt consistency throughout the website.

The other modules that will not follow the rectangular design are the contact page which will contain a Google Maps embed instead of a static image along with descriptive directions and the university page will follow the design principles of the 4 River Restaraunt (see below) to highlight each school.

### Design Inspiration

One of the main issues with the Florida Energy Systems Consortium Site (http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu/) is that it is a very busy website.  There are multiple navigation bars to review and there is neither a consistent layout or color palette.  To aid users in navigating the site there is a need to simplify the overall design.

The first step in simplifying the design is implementing a visually appealing and easy to navigate homepage.  While looking for inspiration from existing websites I stumbled across the home page of 10 Thousand Design (https://www.10thousanddesign.com/) and immediately saw how the design choices could be applied to the FESC website.

The webpage includes visually appealing background images that change based on the content category you highlight.  The webpage is very easy to navigate.  It has the main links that are visible in the main content area of the page, a hamburger menu in the top right and the company logo in the top left that returns to the homepage.

The images do a great job of helping the user identify the type of content they will find with each link.  If the content the user is looking for is not available in that list, there is the hamburger menu.  The hamburger menu when clicked uses a smooth animation to transition to the menu, which takes up the entire screen.  In total, the main page contains sixteen total links while the FESC page has at least thirty.  The hamburger menu is also something I would like to implement on every page of the site so that the menu is consistent across the site.

A minor element that would improve the FESC site is a call to action button in the top right to allow users to signup for the mailing list instead of placing a form input at the bottom of the page.  This way the call along with the hamburger menu would be consistent across the site.  A site with a good example of a call to action button is Dropbox (https://www.dropbox.com/business), although their button blends in a little too much, however.

One of the issues with the FESC Website is the sheer number of subpages that one needs to navigate through.  One way to reduce the number of subpages is to design pages with content organized vertically instead of organized on separate webpages.  This seems more common with modern webpages and Dursun is a great example of an effective implementation of vertical scrolling (https://www.dursun-limousine.ch/).  Outside of the homepage, vertical scrolling makes sense to implement on the other FESC pages to improve user navigation.

A more visually appealing way to display the partner universities is to implement something similar to what 4 Rivers Smokehouse uses to highlight their restaurant locations (https://4rsmokehouse.com/locations/) with images of each restaurant and then on hover information about each restaurant appears to the user.  Instead of stuffing the university logos at the bottom of each page, a dedicated partner page could be developed with an image of the university campus.  Then hovering over the image brings up a link to the university website and a brief description of their roll in FESC.

Images that appear flat on the page are not as visually appealing as those that appear "3D" or have shadow effects.  One such example of the use of drop shadow is on Clearbit's website (https://clearbit.com/).  Where possible I would like to implement some form of 3D imagery on the FESC website.
