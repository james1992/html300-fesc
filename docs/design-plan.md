# Site Design Plan

### Colors, typography and layout


### Design Components

One of the main issues with the Florida Energy Systems Consortium Site (http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu/) is that it is a very busy website.  There are multiple navigation bars to review and there is neither a consistent layout or color palette.  To aid users in navigating the site there is a need to simplify the overall design.

The first step in simplifying the design is implementing a visually appealing and easy to navigate homepage.  While looking for inspiration from existing websites I stumbled across the home page of 10 Thousand Design (https://www.10thousanddesign.com/) and immediately saw how the design choices could be applied to the FESC website.

The webpage includes visually appealing background images that change based on the content category you highlight.  The webpage is very easy to navigate.  It has the main links that are visible in the main content area of the page, a hamburger menu in the top right and the company logo in the top left that returns to the homepage.

The images do a great job of helping the user identify the type of content they will find with each link.  If the content the user is looking for is not available in that list, there is the hamburger menu.  The hamburger menu when clicked uses a smooth animation to transition to the menu, which takes up the entire screen.  In total, the main page contains sixteen total links while the FESC page has at least thirty.  The hamburger menu is also something I would like to implement on every page of the site so that the menu is consistent across the site.

A minor element that would improve the FESC site is a call to action button in the top right to allow users to signup for the mailing list instead of placing a form input at the bottom of the page.  This way the call along with the hamburger menu would be consistent across the site.  A site with a good example of a call to action button is Dropbox (https://www.dropbox.com/business), although their button blends in a little too much, however.

One of the issues with the FESC Website is the sheer number of subpages that one needs to navigate through.  One way to reduce the number of subpages is to design pages with content organized vertically instead of organized on separate webpages.  This seems more common with modern webpages and Dursun is a great example of an effective implementation of vertical scrolling (https://www.dursun-limousine.ch/).  Outside of the homepage, vertical scrolling makes sense to implement on the other FESC pages to improve user navigation.

A more visually appealing way to display the partner universities is to implement something similar to what 4 Rivers Smokehouse uses to highlight their restaurant locations (https://4rsmokehouse.com/locations/) with images of each restaurant and then on hover information about each restaurant appears to the user.  Instead of stuffing the university logos at the bottom of each page, a dedicated partner page could be developed with an image of the university campus.  Then hovering over the image brings up a link to the university website and a brief description of their roll in FESC.

Images that appear flat on the page are not as visually appealing as those that appear "3D" or have shadow effects.  One such example of the use of drop shadow is on Clearbit's website (https://clearbit.com/).  Where possible I would like to implement some form of 3D imagery on the FESC website.
